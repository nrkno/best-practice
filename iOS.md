# Best practices for iOS development at NRK

Always leave code cleaner than you found it, [Uncle Bob says](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule)
Write code like you care - both for the whole app and your individual part
Refactor old sins to best of your current knowledge

## Architecture

## Dokumentation

1. Confluence is used for general documentation
1. HeaderDoc can be used for classes, structs, methods 
1. Code should be self documentating and self explainatory as much as possible
  * If it is: Don't write comments for such code
  * If it isn't: Write comments for exceptional and complex code
1. Readability trumps coolness
