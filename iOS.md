# Best practices for iOS development at NRK

Always leave code cleaner than you found it, [Uncle Bob says](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule)
Write code like you care - both for the whole app and your individual part
Refactor old sins to best of your current knowledge

## Architecture

## Documentation

1. Confluence is used for general documentation
1. HeaderDoc can be used for classes, structs, methods 
1. Code should be self documentating and self explainatory as much as possible
  * If it is: Don't write comments for such code
  * If it isn't: Write comments for exceptional and complex code
1. Readability trumps coolness

## Comments

 When they are needed, comments should be used to explain **why** a particular piece of code does something instead of **what**. Any comments that are used must be kept up-to-date or deleted.

**Preferred:**

```swift
/**
  so far this is the scroll-to-bottom method that works best with proper animation 
  and no issues so far regardless of a scrollviews content size. if this looks and 
  feels like a hack, it's because it is. by creating a rect that's 1x1, pointed at 
  the bottom-right side of the scrollview's content and telling it to scroll there 
  regardless of insets and offsets it will scroll to the very bottom.
*/
func scrollToBottom() {
    let attemptsToRecreateUploadTasksForBackgroundSessions = self.collectionView.contentSize
    let bottomRect = CGRect(x: contentSize.width - 1, y: contentSize.height - 1, width: 1, height: 1)
    let visibleRect = self.collectionView.layer.visibleRect
    if !visibleRect.intersects(bottomRect) {
        self.collectionView.scrollRectToVisible(bottomRect, animated: true)
    }
}
```

**Not Preferred:**

```swift
// scrolls to the bottom of the view
func scrollToBottom() {
    let contentSize = self.collectionView.contentSize
    let bottomRect = CGRect(x: contentSize.width - 1, y: contentSize.height - 1, width: 1, height: 1)
    let visibleRect = self.collectionView.layer.visibleRect
    if !visibleRect.intersects(bottomRect) {
        self.collectionView.scrollRectToVisible(bottomRect, animated: true)
    }
}
```
